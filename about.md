# FLEL

When I worked in [David Mladenoff][DM]'s lab at the University of Wisconsin from 2004 to 2007, it was called the __Forest Landscape Ecology Lab__ (FLEL).
Here's a snapshot taken in 2004 of the [lab's home page][FLEL] in the Internet Archives.

The lab is now called the [Forest Ecosystem and Landscape Ecology Lab][FELE].

title:  LANDIS-II Enhancement Ideas (LEIs)
---

I've been involved with the [LANDIS-II project][] since 2004.
During my 12 years in the community, I've seen a lot of issues with the L-II software and how we develop it.
Places where we could definitely improve our code and our processes.
Our community has addressed many of these issues, yet some still remain unresolved.

Over the years, I've had plenty of time to mull over these open issues (_while tooling along the interstate, or lying awake wondering if my brain would go back to sleep_).
All that reflection has actually produced some ideas to improve or enhance L-II.

Although I've discussed a few ideas with some community members, I've rarely gotten around to documenting them.
So this series of posts is an opportunity to finally write them down.
They'll finally exist somewhere else other than in my head (_which, lord knows, could use to have some memory freed up_).

The ideas vary in their degree of completeness.
Some are more fully formed, almost to the point of being technical proposals.
Others are still partially formed, needing more research and refinement.

The title of this series reflects that broad range -- these are ideas, not just proposals.
Besides, not only is LEI a way better acronym than LEP, it resonates with me more because of a personal connection to the Aloha state.

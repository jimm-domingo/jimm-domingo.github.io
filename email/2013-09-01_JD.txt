Hi Rob.

I can't access the new site (the second link below).  It asks for a Portland State University sign-in, so it seems the site is not accessible to the general public.

I don't think the instructions in the first link apply to this situation.  They would probably work if you were mapping the "landis-ii.org" domain to another domain at PSU (say for example, the subdomain "landis-ii.pdx.edu").  But CNAME records don't work with URLs like the link to the new site.

I think the issue is that the new site is part of the Google Apps account for Portland State.  I suspect that L-II needs its own Google Apps account.  Fortunately, Google has a special program for non-profits:

   https://www.google.com/nonprofits/

This may be a situation where the new L-II Foundation comes in handy :-)

Jimm

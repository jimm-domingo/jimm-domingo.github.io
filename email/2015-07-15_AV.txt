Hi Brian,

Unlike subversion, it is not possible to clone a subset of Git repository -
it is all or nothing.

Branching is very different from subversion too - there are no 'branches'
directory anymore, branch is always a branch of whole repository. There is
main "master" branch and as many user-created branches derived from master.
So it may be a good idea to eliminate trunk/branch/tags structure in
LANDIS-II git repositories in future when all old-style "branches" are
merged - it is not how git works.

But do not afraid of making branches - it is very lightweight process in
git, and you can switch between branches easily. BTW, you can make branches
locally without pushing them to the central server (I do not recommend
doing this though, but may come handy if you can coding on a plane or in
Rocky Mountains and do not have Internet access)

I prefer using GUI client for working with git repositories. I use build-in
git client in my Python IDE and SourceTree, but sounds like TortoiseGit is
good too, and they all have UI for creating and merging branches. On a
command line you do something like

git branch my_branch

git checkout my_branch

Note that 'git checkout' is totally different from 'svn checkout', it is a
command to switch to a different branch instead. Very cheap operation - as
you have a complete copy of your repository on your local machine.

To merge branch to master (git's term for trunk) the following commands are
used (but I think this is where GUI is a must)!

git checkout master

git merge my_branch


Note that after "git checkout master" your local files will be overwritten
with their copies in "master" branch. No worries, your changes are not lost
and you can get them back by doing "git checkout my_branch"
I hope this helps and not too confusing.

If you need help on a specific problem, I'd be glad to assist. We are
switching to Git here at Center for Research Computing, and running into
the same problems basically.

Best Regards,
Alex

.=C2=A0 So far with GitHub, I only see how to clone an entire repository at=
 once (e.g.,=C2=A0Extensions-Output).=C2=A0 I don&#39;t see how to check ou=
t only output-biomass, for example.=C2=A0 Likewise, I was thinking about ma=
king a branch for one of the extensions, but it appears that this would cre=
ate a branch for the entire repository.</div><div><br></div><div>I got used=
 to working with the code a certain way with SVN and Google code, and I&#39=
;m sure I will get used to the way it works in GitHub as well.=C2=A0 I coul=
d just use a few pointers to help me figure out the GitHub equivalents to t=
he way I used to do things.=C2=A0 I&#39;ve done some reading on how GitHub =
works, and I=C2=A0did successfully make some code changes today and commit =
and push them on the repository, so it&#39;s not totally confusing to me.=
=C2=A0 I just want to make sure I&#39;m not missing something on the checko=
ut/cloning of code before I get too deep.=C2=A0 Thanks in advance for any a=
dvice!</div><div><br></div><div>Cheers,</div><div>-Brian</div><span class=

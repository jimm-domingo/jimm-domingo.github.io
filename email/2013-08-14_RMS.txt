Jimm,

The recent outage has prompted me to put web site migration on the front
burner.  Would you have time in the next few weeks to give me some pointers
how the URL is transferred from one site to another?  It could be as easy
as going into GoDaddy and pushing buttons but I have NO idea.

I've been using Google Sites for my lab platform and I'm excited about
migrating landis-ii.org.  There are many great features, particularly
around giving permissions to individual pages: an opportunity to further
empower our developers!

Thanks,

R

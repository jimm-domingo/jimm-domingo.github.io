Jimm,

Thanks for getting back to me.

I may be able to pull it off myself although I welcome your input:

http://support.godaddy.com/help/article/6031/mapping-your-domain-name-to-work-with-google-sites?pc_split_value=4

It sounds straight-forward; is it?

Here's the new site:

https://sites.google.com/a/pdx.edu/landis-ii/

Cheers,

Rob

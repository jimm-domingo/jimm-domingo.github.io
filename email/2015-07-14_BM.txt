Hi everyone,

I am new to GitHub and started poking around with it today.  In the process 
I have run into a few questions that I am hoping those with more GitHub 
experience can explain for me.  The first question I ran into is how to 
properly check out code.  I gather that in GitHub you actually just get a 
clone of the code and then once code changes have been committed, they are 
'pushed' back to the repository.  With SVN on Google code, I was able to 
just checkout the portion of the code that I was interested in working 
with; for example the 'src' folder for a single extension.  So far with 
GitHub, I only see how to clone an entire repository at once 
(e.g., Extensions-Output).  I don't see how to check out only 
output-biomass, for example.  Likewise, I was thinking about making a 
branch for one of the extensions, but it appears that this would create a 
branch for the entire repository.

I got used to working with the code a certain way with SVN and Google code, 
and I'm sure I will get used to the way it works in GitHub as well.  I 
could just use a few pointers to help me figure out the GitHub equivalents 
to the way I used to do things.  I've done some reading on how GitHub 
works, and I did successfully make some code changes today and commit and 
push them on the repository, so it's not totally confusing to me.  I just 
want to make sure I'm not missing something on the checkout/cloning of code 
before I get too deep.  Thanks in advance for any advice!

Cheers,
-Brian

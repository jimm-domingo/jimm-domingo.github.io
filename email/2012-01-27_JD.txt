Hi everyone.

It was great to see you all at the LANDIS-II meeting a couple weeks
ago (I returned home to Arlington, MA from my road trip two nights
ago).  Always a fun and productive time.

Thanks to Jodi for helping me with access to the "svn" computer in
FLEL's room 110.  I took advantage of being on campus to go through
the files and software on this computer.  I reviewed the Subversion
repositories that we had hosted on that computer over the years.
These repositories were used to track the changes in source code
and documentation.  Of the 8 repositories present, four of them
qualified for archiving.

So I dumped the contents of these 4 repositories, and uploaded the
dump files to our web hosting provider, WebFaction.  To confirm
that the files were transferred without error, I re-loaded their
contents into empty repositories.  These archival repositories can
be viewed on the web at:

   http://flel.landis-ii.org/websvn/

After the repositories had been successfully transferred, I
uninstalled the Subversion software from the svn computer.  I also
disabled the Plone web content management system that we used for
the initial L-II web site, as well as the Apache web server.  I
removed these applications so there's no possibility of restarting
them (they are out of date and hence pose security risks).

With this clean-up, the svn computer can now be re-purposed as FLEL
sees fit.  Thanks for providing that system for the L-II project's
use for the past 7 years!

Jimm

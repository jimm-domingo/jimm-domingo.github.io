We switched to GitHub for another of my projects that was previously on 
Google Code. I will share a few links here that were helpful for me. Would 
appreciate if others did the same as I'm still interested in learning more 
about GitHub.

Why you should switch from Subversion to Git 
<http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/why-you-should-switch-from-subversion-to-git>
Pro Git <http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2> (an online book)
Cheat shee 
<http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/files/git_cheat_sheet.pdf>t for Git 
commands
TortoiseGit <https://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/>
GitHub for Windows <https://windows.github.com/> (I am using this client 
along with the command line)

As Adam pointed out, GitHub can be integrated with Visual Studio but I have 
not tried this.
